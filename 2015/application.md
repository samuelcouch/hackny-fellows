####Tell us about a time you built something awesome in code. How did you choose it? Why did you enjoy it? 
At HackNY I built an awesome application called fishcryption. I chose this project because I wanted to learn more about encryption beyond just using the standard libraries and common methods. It basically allows two users to pass messages to each other via a one-of-a-kind encryption scheme. Using the location of Grayson the fish, a unique salt is created at send-time. The app was built using node.js and a lot of tears; it turns out that time-delimited-encryption is a really hard challenge. Especially when dealing with a truly random variable, like a fish, it is virtually impossible to mathematically decrypt our messages. Architecting this app was a task in itself. Creating a unique salt and then storing it right alongside the encoded message is laughably insecure. I really enjoyed working through this problem though. To call it a crash course would be an understatement. I had to get down in the nitty-gritty, *salty*, mess that is encryption. I didn't finish, but I am definitely *hooked* on solving hard problems.

#### Is there a particular technology or industry you're currently interested in? How come? Where do you see it heading in the future? 
I'm really interested in consumer facing products and specifically working on platforms that connect people to their interests. Whether those interests are in other people, things, or ideas, I think it's a really interesting space with lots of room for creativity, innovation, and imagination. Specifically I think there is room for growth in connecting people in entertainment. Perhaps this will come by means of connecting fans to their favorite artists in a more intimate way, or creating more technologically engaging experiences at events.

#### Discuss your technical skills/proficiencies/languages and experience 
My first line of code was written in BASIC, followed by a short stint dabbling with Pearl. My primary background however is in C++, Java, and Python. Leading up to now, I primarily worked with developing control software for robots. In the last couple months however, I have entered in to the world of webapps developing mainly with Javascript/Node.js.

#### When you're not coding, what do you like to do for fun? 
I love photography -- or probably more accurately, faux-tography. It's always good to take a step back from the computer and adventure around town. Having moved to Philadelphia in the past year, there's always something new for me to see, people to meet, and pictures to snap for my Instagram.

#### Technologies in which you're proficient and would like to work with 
Javascript, jQuery, Python, Nodejs, Java, C

#### Technologies which you have some familiarity with and would be open to working with 
Data science, Front end development, Ruby, Rails, iOS development, Android development

#### Sectors you'd like to work with (e.g., fashion, social, art...) 
Social and crowdfunding

#### Sectors you'd like to avoid 
Healthcare

#### What size startup would you like to work with (total number of employees)? 
51+

#### Any free text you'd like us to add when describing you to proposed host startups? 
I am really eager to work with a team that I can both contribute to and learn a lot from!

#### Code Samples: 
1. c-steganography (http://github.com/samuelcouch/c-steganography): This was a really awesome project. I worked in C because it allows you to interact with the awesome low-level systems of software, out of the box. This project allows you to encrypt and decrypt a secret message hidden within a PPM image file. This is done by performing some clever bit operations on the RGB representations in the image --this is a really cool operation because we can decide the least significant pixels, commandeer them, and use them to pack our message within the image all without changing the file size or visual aesthetic (to the naked eye). 
2. Teespring-api (http://samuelcouch.github.io/teespring-api): I really like the Teespring platform, but I wanted to be able to access shirt campaigns from outside of the Teespring website. This API allows 3rd-party developers to access campaigns in their own apps. I am hoping to eventually expand the API in to being able to pass payments as well.

#### Anything else? 
Beyond the technical, networking and learning opportunities that the HackNY Fellowship provides, I am also really excited by all of the frozen yogurt with New Yorkâ€™s finest in tech!
